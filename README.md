# loris
> Simple penetration test utility for Android

*loris* opens connections to a target web server and holds them open as long as possible.
Servers such as Apache 2.x keep such connections open which causes their maximum concurrent connection pool to fill until new connections are denied and the server stops responding.

Work in Progress
